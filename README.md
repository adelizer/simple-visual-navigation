# simple-visual-navigation

A MatLAB code to process a video input captured by an upward looking camera on a moving planar robot. Visual odometry is used to create 
Odometry Only: shows the trajectory and detected landmarks with only the global position as a descriptor
Bit Patterns: shows the trajectory and detected landmarks with the global position, bit pattern and color as descriptors
Error Correction: shows the trajectory and detected landmarks with the global position as a descriptor and a corrected trajectory.
